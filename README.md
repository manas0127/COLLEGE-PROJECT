# Fuel Consumption & Trip Cost Calculator

## 📌 Project Overview
 It helps users calculate:

* Fuel required for a trip
* Total fuel cost
* Compare multiple vehicles to find the cheapest option
* Save the trip report into a text file

The project uses Python fundamentals such as:

* Functions
* Loops
* Lists
* File handling
* User input & menu-driven programming

## 🚀 Features

### ✔ Add Mileage of Multiple Vehicles

Users can input mileage of any number of vehicles.

### ✔ View Mileage List

Displays all added vehicle mileages.

### ✔ Calculate Fuel & Cost for Each Vehicle

For each vehicle, the program computes:

* Fuel required using **Fuel = Distance / Mileage**
* Trip cost using **Cost = Fuel × Price per liter**

### ✔ Identify Cheapest Vehicle

The program compares trip costs and finds the most economical choice.

### ✔ Save Report to File

A complete summary is saved into `trip_report.txt`.

### ✔ Fully Menu-Driven Program

Simple and beginner-friendly interface.
